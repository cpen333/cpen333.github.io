# Lab 3 -- Testing and Mutexes
{:.no_toc}

In this lab, we will learn about unit testing, and will get some practice with thread synchronization using mutexes.  First we will create a method that counts the number of words in a string, and test this thoroughly to ensure reliability under a variety of circumstances.  Next, we will use this method to help us count how many words each character has to memorize in a collection of plays by Shakespeare.  We will then switch gears and look at synchronization between multiple processes.

To help get you started, some of the code is posted on GitHub [here (https://github.com/cpen333/lab3)](https://github.com/cpen333/lab3).

Feel free to discuss approaches and solutions with your classmates, but labs are to be completed individually.  Each student is expected to be able to answer questions about the content, describe their work, and reproduce their code (or parts thereof).

## Part 1 -- Shakespearean Word Counts

### Counting words and Unit Tests

Consider the function:
```cpp
/**
 * Counts number of words, separated by spaces, in a line.
 * @param line string in which to count words
 * @param start_idx starting index to search for words
 * @return number of words in the line
 */
int word_count(const std::string& line, int start_idx);
```
This method specification tells us that it counts the number of words in a string, with each new word separated by a space from the previous.  It also allows us to specify a starting index within the string to start searching for words.  Think about how you might test this function to see if it is working correctly.  What are some sample strings you think you should test it with?

Once you've thought a bit about the problem for a minute or two, start the implementation.  We will separate the declaration into a header file named `word_count.h` and write the implementation in a `word_count.cpp` file.

`word_count.h`:
```cpp
#ifndef LAB3_WORD_COUNT_H
#define LAB3_WORD_COUNT_H

#include <string>

/**
 * Counts number of words, separated by spaces, in a line.
 * @param line string in which to count words
 * @param start_idx starting index to search for words
 * @return number of words in the line
 */
int word_count(const std::string& line, int start_idx);

#endif //LAB3_WORD_COUNT_H
```

`word_count.cpp`:
```cpp
#include "word_count.h"

// implementation details
int word_count(const std::string& line, int start_idx) {

  // YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE

  return 0;
}
```
Note that we do not need to mark `word_count` as `inline` here because we have separated the declaration from the implementation (*the implementation inside `word_count.cpp` will only be compiled once*).

Think you've implemented the function correctly?  Now we're going to test it.  Unit tests are usually written in a separate file so that it doesn't clutter your actual code, adding extra functions to your final products.  We are going to manually create some unit tests in a file called `word_count_test.cpp`:

```cpp
#include "word_count.h"
#include <exception>
#include <iostream>

// Exception class to throw for unit test failures
class UnitTestException : public std::exception {
  std::string line_;
  int start_idx_;
  int result_;
  int expected_;

 public:

  // constructor collecting all information
  UnitTestException(const std::string& line, int start_idx,
                    int result, int expected) : line_(line), start_idx_(start_idx),
                                                result_(result), expected_(expected) {}

  const char* what() {
    return "Unit test failed";
  }

  std::string info() {
    std::string out;
    out.append("line: ");
    out.append(line_);
    out.append(", start_idx: ");
    out.append(std::to_string(start_idx_));
    out.append(", result: ");
    out.append(std::to_string(result_));
    out.append(", expected: ");
    out.append(std::to_string(expected_));
    return out;
  }

};

/**
 * Tests count_words for the given line and starting index
 * @param line line in which to search for words
 * @param start_idx starting index in line to search for words
 * @param expected expected answer
 * @throws UnitTestException if the test fails
 */
void wc_tester(const std::string& line, int start_idx, int expected) {

  int result = word_count(line, start_idx);

  // if not what we expect, throw an error
  if (result != expected) {
    throw UnitTestException(line, start_idx, result, expected);
  }

}

int main() {

  try {

    // YOUR TESTS HERE

    wc_tester("hello world", 0, 2);

  } catch(UnitTestException &ute) {
    std::cout << ute.info() << std::endl;
  }

}
```

We start by creating an exception class called `UnitTestException` that will be `thrown` whenever one of our tests fail.  This exception should store everything we need to know about the failed test to help us debug.  In the above code, `UnitTestException` captures all the inputs to the `word_count` function, the result, and the expected result.

We then define a *tester* function that takes the inputs along with an expected answer, calls our `word_count` function, then throws the exception if we get something unexpected.

Finally, our main method has a `try - catch` block that should call our tester function with a variety of inputs and expected outputs.  If any tests fail, the `catch` part catches the exception and prints out information about the failed test so we can try to debug our code.

**Your task:** add a variety of tests in an attempt to "break" your own code.  You should have enough tests so that you've covered all expected *behaviours* of your method.  Think about possible partitions of the input space, as well as boundary/edge/corner cases.  In particular, think about:
- different numbers of words in a string
- different starting indices
- different lengths of strings
- extra spaces at the start, end, or between words
- ...?

### Maps

Maps are *incredibly* useful data structures.  Conceptually, they are quite simple: all they do is associate pairs of data together.  Think about an array or vector.  When you set `array[10] = "Steve"`, in some sense you are associating the number 10 with the name *Steve*.  You can later retrieve the name associated with number 10 using the `std::string name = array[10]`.  

Maps allow us to generalize this, associating pretty much any type of data with any other type of data.  For example, we can have a map of strings to numbers using
```cpp
#include <map>
//...
std::map<std::string,int> map;
map["Steve"] = 10;
```
A map *maps* data from a *key* to a *value*.  In the above, the keys are of type `std::string`, and the values are of type `int`.  For `std::map`, the only (default) restriction on keys is that they are comparable with a `<` operator.  If you have a class that does not implement `<` but you still want to use it as a key in a map, you can write your own comparator (we will do this later when it comes to sorting).

The key and value are stored in the map as an `std::pair`.  Pairs have two member variables:
```cpp
std::pair<std::string,int> kv("Tiffany", 786);
std::string key = kv.first;
int val = kv.second;
```
We can add key-value pairs directly into the map using
```cpp
map.insert(std::pair<std::string,int>("Georgia", 15));
// or
map.insert({"Georgia", 15});
```
Keys are considered unique in a map, so if you later assign
```cpp
map["Georgia"] = 16;
```
this will overwrite the original value.

You can check a map to see if a particular key exists using the `find(...)` method:
```cpp
auto it = map.find("Gregory");
if (it == map.end()) {
  // not found
} else {
  // found
  std::string key = it->first;
  int val = it->second;
}
```
The `find(...)` method returns an *iterator*, which you can treat similarly to a pointer.  If the key is not found in the map, the map's `.end()` is returned, otherwise an iterator to the item is returned which lets you access the key-value pair directly.  Iterators can be dereferenced just like pointers, and you can access their members using the `->` operator just like pointers.

You can iterate through all the entries in a map just like for a vector or any other iterable:
```cpp
for (const auto& pair : map) {
  std::cout << pair.first << "->" << pair.second << std::endl;
}
```
You should find that the map iterates through the keys in increasing order (in our case, alphabetically).

### Sorting

We've already seen how to implement sorting algorithms like QuickSort, but do we want to do this every time from scratch when we need to sort a new data type?  Of course not.  Luckily for us, the `<algorithm>` library is here to help us.  We can easily sort a set of strings, for example, by calling
```cpp
#include <algorithm>
//...
std::vector<std::string> names = {"Bob", "Xin", "Mohammad", "Carlos"};

std::sort(names.begin(), names.end());
```
The `sort(...)` method takes in two *iterators*, and sorts everything in between (including the first but excluding the second).  This works fine for things like strings that have a natural comparison operator, like `<`, but how do we handle sorting of some other data structures, like pairs of objects?  Well, we write a *comparator*.  Comparators are things that accept two instances of your objects (usually by const reference), and returns a boolean that is `true` if the items are in the correct order, or `false` if they should be switched.  You can write a method as a comparator, or a class... anything that has the form
```cpp
bool compare(const type& a, const type& b);
```
For example, we could write a comparator method for strings that would sort in reverse order using
```cpp
bool reverse_compare(const std::string& a, const std::string& b) {
  return a > b;
}
```
and then use this method to sort our list of names by supplying the comparator:
```cpp
std::sort(names.begin(), names.end(), reverse_compare);
```
The one thing you want to watch out for is that you want your comparator to enforce a *unique* ordering.  For example, let's say we want to sort pairs of `{name, number}` by increasing number.  If we write our comparator as
```cpp
bool bad_sort_by_number(const std::pair<std::string,int>& a, const std::pair<std::string,int>& b) {
  return a.second < b.second;
}
```
then the ordering would not be unique, because if two *different* names are paired with the same number, it would be random which one would come first once sorted.  So, you'll want to do something like
- sort by numbers first
- sort by names second if numbers are equal

### Counting Words in Shakespeare

Shakespeare's characters talk a lot in his plays.  For example, Othello says approximately 12000 words, and Romeo about 10000.  That's a lot of memorization.  What characters say the most in all of Shakespeare's plays?

We already have a word count function that we can make use of.  Now all we need are some files to use it on.

Project Gutenburg offers free digital copies of a lot of literary works for which the copyright has either expired or never existed.  It's a great resource for reading many of the classics.  In the GitHub `data` folder [here](https://github.com/cpen333/lab3/tree/master/data) you will find all of Shakespeare's works.  Note that not all of them are plays though.

If you open one of the plays, such as Romeo and Juliet, you will notice that *most* lines containing dialogue either begin with two or with four spaces.  If the line starts with two, then the line contains the name (or short-form) of the character speaking, followed by a period, followed by the character's dialogue.  If the line starts with four, it is usually a continuation of the previous character's lines.  This approach is by no means perfect, but should be sufficient for us to determine which Shakespearean character is the most verbose.

We have provided much of the code for you in this exercise.  We will map *Character* &rightarrow; *Word Count* in an `std::map`.  We will parse a selection of Shakespeare's plays, extract the speakers of each line of dialogue, count the number of words, and update the counts in the map.  This should all be done in a multithreaded way.

```cpp
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <mutex>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>
#include <thread>

#include "word_count.h"

/**
 * Checks if the line specifies a character's dialogue, returning
 * the index of the start of the dialogue.  If the
 * line specifies a new character is speaking, then extracts the
 * character's name.
 *
 * Assumptions: (doesn't have to be perfect)
 *     Line that starts with exactly two spaces has
 *       CHARACTER. <dialogue>
 *     Line that starts with exactly four spaces
 *       continues the dialogue of previous character
 *
 * @param line line to check
 * @param character extracted character name if new character,
 *        otherwise leaves character unmodified
 * @return index of start of dialogue if a dialogue line,
 *      -1 if not a dialogue line
 */
int is_dialogue_line(const std::string& line, std::string& character) {

  // new character
  if (line.length() >= 3 && line[0] == ' '
      && line[1] == ' ' && line[2] != ' ') {
    // extract character name

    int start_idx = 2;
    int end_idx = 3;
    while (end_idx <= line.length() && line[end_idx-1] != '.') {
      ++end_idx;
    }

    // no name found
    if (end_idx >= line.length()) {
      return 0;
    }

    // extract character's name
    character = line.substr(start_idx, end_idx-start_idx-1);
    return end_idx;
  }

  // previous character
  if (line.length() >= 5 && line[0] == ' '
      && line[1] == ' ' && line[2] == ' '
      && line[3] == ' ' && line[4] != ' ') {
    // continuation
    return 4;
  }

  return 0;
}

```
The code leaves several sections blank.  It is your job to fill in these sections.

#### Accessing the Data

The data files need to be someplace where your program can find them.  One way is to hard-code the path in the list of filenames, however this will not be very portable between machines.  

The easier way is to copy the data over to the same directory as the executable (or the directory you run the executable from), then use relative path names for your files.  If you are using CMake, this will automatically be taken care of for you.

A third option is to modify your project settings so that the working directory is the root of where your data files can be found.  You can do this in Visual Studio by right-clicking on your project and selecting `Properties > Debugging > Working Directory`.  By default this is set to the project directory, so as long as the `data` folder is in the project directory itself, it can be found using relative pathnames.  Otherwise, you can set an appropriate working directory to make this easier.

#### Thread Safety

If two threads try to modify the *Character* &rightarrow; *Word Count* map concurrently, the behaviour is undefined.  Sometimes this will throw an error immediately, sometimes everything will *appear* to work correctly (as in it won't crash) but the results you get will vary slightly every time you run your program.  Sometimes you'll get an error when the program tries to exit.

If the program doesn't crash right away, these concurrent modification errors can be very difficult to track down and fix.  If ever your program crashes when it closes, it's because you have overrun some memory somewhere.  It was possibly overwriting some other variables in the process, but didn't do enough damage to trigger an error at the time.  You see the error at the end as the program tries to clean up and notices... hey, this vector/map/array was supposed to be done by now, but seems to keep going!

You need to protect access to your map if it is shared between threads by applying *mutual exclusion*.  For this, you have access to the standard library implementation `<mutex>`, which provides `std::mutex`, `std::lock_guard`, and `std::unique_lock`.

As you are protecting access to your shared map, think about critical section *localization*.  What is the smallest section of code that needs to be protected?  The narrower you can make this region, the more the multiple threads can execute in parallel.  If you lock your mutex at the beginning of a method and unlock it at the end, then calls to that method will behave as if called sequentially.  You want to try to maximize concurrency.
